    "# Python fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many python tutorials aimed at teaching the fundamentals and we do not intend to duplicate these here. Instead, we will introduce some of the basic concepts which you are most likely to encounter. To dig further there's the official [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and you may also wish to look at the interactive exercises at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will look at variables (data), control flow (how we decide what to do), functions (names given to chunks of code to enable reuse) and modules (collections of code which can add extra functionality). "

    "## Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are essentially named boxes in which we store values. You are probably familiar with this concept from maths, however variables in programming can behave a little differently. Firstly we often redefine the variable, i.e. we change what values are stored in that named box, and secondly variables might contain different types of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the below we create a variable `x` which initially stores the numeric value `0`. We then decide `x` is in fact 1. Next we redefine `x` to be `x + 1` (which is 2) and finally we change the value of `x` to store some text (known as a string).\n"

    "Clearly this didn't do what we wanted! It's important to remember that python is a general purpose programming language, whilst we're mostly interested in numerical operations python is not designed around this. Lists and most of the basic data types in python are general purpose and hence not optimised for numerical/scientific operations. Fortunately it's possible to define our own types which do behave as we would expect. Even better, we can make use of types defined by other people and this is where the use of modules to extend the core functionality of python makes our life _much_ easier."
