    "There are many python tutorials aimed at teaching the fundamentals and we do not intend to duplicate these here. Instead, we will introduce some of the basic concepts which you are most likely to encounter. To dig further there's the official [python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html) and you may also wish to look at the interactive exercises at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/default.asp).\n",

    "Variables are essentially named boxes in which we store values. You are probably familiar with this concept from maths, however variables in programming can behave a little differently. Firstly we often redefine the variable, i.e. we change what values are stored in that named box, and secondly variables might contain different types of data.\n",
