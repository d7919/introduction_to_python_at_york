Firstly always looping over lists of values leads to verbose code, it would be much nicer if we could just write `the_values = the_values * 0.001` here. Secondly for each operation python has to check the data types of the values involved to work out what to do -- recall that lists can store different data types, `value * 0.001` might have to do different things depending on what type value is. This means that looping over lists can be quite slow.\n",
