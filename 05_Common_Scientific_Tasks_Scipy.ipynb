    "# Using scipy for common scientific tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "Within scientific tasks there are a wide range of mathematical and analysis techniques which we might want to employ, fortunately the [`scipy`](https://scipy.org) module provides a wide range of functionality which supports such common tasks. Due to the breadth of tasks `scipy` is structured as a collection of sub-packages each of which deals with a particular area. There's a list of the subpackages on the [scipy user guide](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/tutorial/index.html#user-guide). We won't use all of these in the computational plasma physics course, but you're likely to use a large fraction of these through your time at York. Of particular note are:\n",

    "1. [integrate](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/integrate.html#module-scipy.integrate) : Tools to integrate the area under curves _and_ to integrate equations.\n",
    "2. [linalg](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/linalg.html#module-scipy.linalg) : Tools for linear algebra (solving matrix equations).\n",
    "3. [optimize](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/optimize.html#module-scipy.optimize) : Minimisation and optimisation of functions (e.g. curve fitting)\n",
    "4. [stats](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/stats.html#module-scipy.stats) : Statistical tools\n",
    "5. [interpolate](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/interpolate.html#module-scipy.interpolate) : Interpolate data to allow smoothing etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't cover all of these subpackages here and we won't need all aspects of each of these, but it might be worth having a look through to give yourself an idea of what these provide.\n",

    "1. Where we know the value on a fixed number of points, e.g. we've measured some quantity at discrete fixed locations.\n",
    "2. Where we have a mathematical/numerical function which we can evaluate at any number of points we want.\n",

For example suppose we've measured the height of an object at several points and want to work out the surface area of one of the faces:"
