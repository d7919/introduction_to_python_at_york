    "1. Read the [`curve_fit` documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html) to see if you can work out how to modify the example code to include errors on $f$ in the fit _and_ how to calculate the error on the resulting fit parameter `b`. _Hint: a web search containing \"curve_fit error on...\" might also help._\n",
    "2. Modify the code to at least calculate the error on `b` and propagate this through to give you an error on $T$. The data was generated with $T = 10,000,000 K$, does the value from the fit agree within error?\n",
    "3. The fit parameter, `a`, corresponds to the Maxwellian parameter $A$. In fact, here we can define $A = 4 n/\\left(\\sqrt{\\pi} v_{th}\\right)$ where $n$ is known as the number density of the plasma. Given the existing code work out the number density of the plasma (ideally including errors).\n",
    "4. The number density, $n$, can also be written as $n = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty{f(v) dv}$. Given the $f(v)$ data from experiment calculate $n$ without fitting. Compare your value to the fit from 3, do they agree?"
